Architecture Components:
Client-Side:
    Users access the platform via web browsers or mobile applications.
Load Balancer:
    Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
    Ensures high availability and reliability by routing traffic to healthy servers.
    
Web/Application Servers:
    Serve the web content and handle application logic.
    Typically deployed in an auto-scaling group to handle varying traffic loads.
    Can be containerized (e.g., using Docker) and managed with orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes).
    
Content Delivery Network (CDN):
    Delivers static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) quickly to users by caching content at edge locations around the world.
    
Microservices:
    Break down the application into smaller, independent services (e.g., user service, product service, order service).
    Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    Communicate with each other using APIs (typically RESTful or gRPC).
    
Database:
    Use a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases.
    SQL for transactional data (e.g., user accounts, orders).
    NoSQL for scalable storage of unstructured data (e.g., product catalog, user sessions).
    
Cache:  
    In-memory caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to speed up frequent queries and reduce load on the database.
    Session management to store user sessions for quick retrieval.
    
Search Engine:
    Use search engine services (e.g., Elasticsearch) to provide fast and efficient product search   capabilities.
    
Security Components:
    Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits.
    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt data between the client and server.
    Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control.
    
Monitoring and Logging:
    Centralized logging system 
    (e.g., ELK stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for collecting and analyzing logs.
    Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for tracking system performance and health.
    
Backup and Disaster Recovery:
    Regular backups of databases and critical data.
    Disaster recovery plan to ensure quick recovery in case of failures.
    
Message Queue:
    Asynchronous communication between services using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
